# Global Superstore – Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
---

## Problem Statement  
Global Superstore lacked real‑time visibility into critical sales KPIs—total revenue, product mix, geographic performance and segment profitability—which led to slow reaction times to seasonal dips and missed cross‑sell opportunities.  

## Project Objectives 
Build a comprehensive Sales Analysis, Product Analysis and Shipping Analysis dashboard in Power BI to track performance, compare against prior periods, and enable interactive drill‑down into markets, categories, and customer segments.
