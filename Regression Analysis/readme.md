### üî¨ Methodology

#### Data Preparation

- Addressed missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Engineered new features:
  - **Profit Margin**: Profit as a percentage of sales.
  - **Sales per Item**: Unit sales price.
  - **Discount Amount**: Sales √ó Discount.
- Converted datetime features to numeric representations.
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

### üìä Models Developed

| Model                 | R¬≤ Score | Mean Squared Error (MSE) |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| **Linear Regression** | 0.5185   | 6929.5130                |
| **Random Forest**     | 0.6853   | 4528.6875                |

### üåü Key Profit Drivers (Feature Importance)

- **Sales**: Importance score ~0.38-0.40.
- **Discount Amount**: Importance score ~0.25-0.28.
- **Shipping Cost**: Importance score ~0.07.
- **Product-Specific Factors**: High-margin items.
- **Sales per Item**: Unit price.
- **Order Timing**: Day-of-week patterns.

### üìà Profit Distribution Insights

- **Profit Margins**: Most transactions cluster around low profit margins (0-100).
- **Loss-Making Transactions**: Significant portion shows negative profit.
- **Technology Category**: Highest average profit.
- **Outliers**: Extreme positive and negative profit outliers.

#### Discount Strategy Analysis

- **0-10% Discount**: Highest profit, many positive outliers.
- **10-40% Discount**: Moderate but stable profit.
- **50-80% Discount**: Consistently negative profit.
- **Correlation**: Strong negative correlation (-0.36) between discount and profit.

### üí° Business Recommendations

#### Optimize Discount Strategy:

- Limit discounts to **0-20%** for most products.
- Avoid high discounts (**>50%**) which lead to losses.

#### Focus on High-Margin Products:

- Prioritize **technology category** products with highest profitability.
- Promote high-performing products identified in feature importance.

#### Review Shipping Strategies:

- Analyze shipping costs to improve profit margins.
- Explore alternative shipping options for the **furniture category**.

#### Implement Predictive Analytics:

- Use the **Random Forest model** (68.5% accuracy) to forecast profit for new orders.
- Flag potential loss-making transactions before fulfillment.
